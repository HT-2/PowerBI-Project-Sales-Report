# PowerBI-Project-Sales-Report
This is a PowerBI dashboard created on sales data to showcase the sales performance for a client. The breakdown of different visualizations are as follows:

1. **Sales by Category**:
   - This bar chart breaks down sales by different store categories (e.g., Novelty Shop, Grocery Store, Computer Store).
   - Each category is represented by a bar, and the height of the bar corresponds to the total sales figure for that category.
   - It helps identify which categories contribute the most to overall sales.

2. **Quantity by Month**:
   - The line graph shows how sales quantities vary across different months.
   - Peaks and valleys in the line indicate seasonal trends or fluctuations.
   - Useful for understanding monthly sales patterns.

3. **Sales Year-on-Year Analysis**:
   - Typically, this analysis compares sales performance year-on-year.
   - It helps assess growth or decline by comparing the current year's sales to the same period in the previous year.

4. **Sales Year-to-Date Analysis**:
   - This analysis tracks cumulative sales from the beginning of the year up to the current month.
   - It provides insights into progress toward annual sales targets.

5. **Sales by Province**:
   - The map visualization displays sales distribution across provinces (e.g., North America).
   - Color intensity or size of markers may represent sales volume in each province.
   - Helps identify regional variations and potential growth areas.

6. **Score Card**:
   - The score card summarizes key metrics:
     - **Total Quantity of Sales**: Indicated as '9M' (presumably 9 million units).
     - **Total Revenue from Sales**: Displayed as '$172.8M' (approximately 172.8 million dollars).
   - These metrics provide a quick snapshot of overall sales performance.
